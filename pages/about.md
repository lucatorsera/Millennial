I am Luca. As I am very lazy, I like to program machines to draw cool stuff for me. I spent some time studying Computer and Electric Engineering, but could not find peace there. Instead, I went on a journey to try and do what I want to do, feed creativity with technology, as a Digital Media Artist. 

If you have a cool idea and you want to collab or request a service, feel free to <a href="https://lucatorsera.github.io/pages/contact.html" target="_blank">contact me</a>

As for now, I am based in Gothenburg, Sweden.
