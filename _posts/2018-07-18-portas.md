### Photo series <br> Projection Mapping, Processing <br> Projector

Doors (Dores), which translates into “pains”, is a photo series that puts the door, the most basic element in a house as a canvas for asking questions about its own part in modern society. What was first a practical mechanical device is now an isolation tool, keeping us all from opening doors in our life path, or a powerful repression tool. The artpiece is the third and final part from the 3106 (copan) series, which explores loss, spontaneity and the complete symbiosis with its site.

The artpiece was made with a processing sketch, mastered by my custom controller to adjust colors and position of the letters and videomapping techniques, turning my apartment’s door into a big and long-shaped white canvas.
