### Music Video <br> Vector synthesis, Pure Data, Processing <br> Oscilloscope, HI-8

Elos Atemporais is a videoclip made for the upcoming EP "TALASSOFOBIA" from sukya || porno, a band from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
The work is my first experimentation in vector synthesis, and was greatly influenced by attending the Vector Hack Festival @ Zagreb, and also represents a return to analog VHS cameras.

The path of two completely different analog signals,<br>
Drawn similarly by cathode ray tubes,<br>
interconnected by two energy fields.

The videoclip featured Giovani Baroni (shown in the Oscilloscope), lead singer of the band and also Allena Arnold; it was shot in my apartment and in different locations in the city of Glasgow, Scotland, with the assistance of the hermano Santiago Taberna (@snnntiago).

With an oscilloscope - an instrument commonly used to visualize electronic waveforms - one can control its cathode rays to display any pattern on the screen using audio waves as an input. In terms of audio source I used a PC with the help of two libraries: Derek Holzer's Pure Data library [_vectorsynth_](http://macumbista.net/?page_id=4985) and Ted Davis' Processing Library [_XYscope_](http://teddavis.org/xyscope/) and also the Oscilloscope Graphic Artist, an electronic circuit designed by Mitchel Waite in the 70's and resurected by Philip Baljeu. These signals were then patched to an ISO-Tech ISR620 oscilloscope, displaying the images which were then captured by a DSLR camera and edited in software (no retouching/video effects). A hi-8 camera was also used to shoot some scenes, specially the ones around Glasgow.
